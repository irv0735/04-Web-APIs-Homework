Homework 4 - Web APIs - Coding Quiz

This site presents the user with a Code Quiz Challenge. When they press Start, they are presented with a series of questions related to web Development coding (specifically javascript fundamentals). This quiz is timed and they are penalized if they select an incorrect answer by time being deducted. If they run out of time, they are not given a chance to enter their score, as it would be 0. The score is the amount of time left at the end. 

I added a bonus deduction if they fail to enter their initials when prompted. 

After entering their initials, they are sent to a high-score page to see how they stack up. An option to start over or reset the score list is available. 

Scores are stored in "local-storage".
